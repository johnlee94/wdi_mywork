    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>There are two players. Player One goes first by clicking once on one of the boxes. Then Player Two makes his or her move by clicking on a different box. Player One is "O", Player Two is "X". The first player to line up three boxes with his or her symbol ("O" or "X") wins. This can be done horizontally, vertically, or diagnally. May the best player emerge victorious!</p>
